# Metaheuristics - a course assignment

This repository is dedicated to my realization of a university assignment. The course in question is Metaheuristics, a course that is part of a master studies program in Applied Mathematics, on the Mathematics Faculty of the University of Belgrade, Serbia. The aim of this project is to learn about metaheuristics through practical implementation. That is, the idea is to implement a metaheuristic, apply it to a set of instances, and analyze the results.
