# Metaheuristics - a course assignment

This repository is dedicated to my realization of a university assignment. The course in question is Metaheuristics, a course that is part of a master studies program in Applied Mathematics, on the Mathematics Faculty of the University of Belgrade, Serbia. The aim of this project is to learn about metaheuristics through practical implementation. That is, the idea is to implement a metaheuristic for a given problem, apply it to a set of instances of that problem, and analyze the results.
## Project structure
Currently, the project consists only of code that is used to generate the instances used for testing. The idea is to expand this repository to include an implementation of the tabu search metaheuristic.
## Programming language
The entire project is implemented in C++.
